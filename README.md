# expression_converter
Converts prefix and postfix expressions

Original guidelines per University of Maryland Global Campus CMSC 350:
The program for this project should consist of three classes. The main class should create a GUI that allows the user to input an expression in either prefix or postfix and convert it to postfix or prefix, respectively. The GUI should look as follows:
The GUI must be generated by code that you write. You may not use a drag-and-drop GUI generator.
The second class should contain the code to perform the conversions.
